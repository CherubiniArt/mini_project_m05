===============================================
INTELLIGENT ENGINE FOR HOUSES PRICES ESTIMATION
===============================================
For Academic purpose: Mini-project for the M05 module
-----------------------------------------------------
This solution is an extension of the project Predicting house prices with machine learning https://www.kimanalytics.com/single-post/2017/09/11/Predicting-House-Prices-with-Machine-Learning of the data scientist Eric kim. 

Goal
=====
The aim of this project is to develop an intelligent tool for predicting house prices through machine learning. Such a tool is useful in that it would allow investors and real estate buyers, as well as the curious, to have an estimate of the value of houses in a given region, but also to know the characteristics that most influence house prices.

In this project, the hypotheses and tests carried out by Eric kim https://github.com/kimanalytics will be re-discussed and other prediction algorithms other than linear regression, i.e. decision trees and random forests, will be implemented in order to see if the prediction solution can be improved.
