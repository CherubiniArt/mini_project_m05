==================================================
# INTELLIGENT ENGINE FOR HOUSES PRICES ESTIMATION
==================================================
## For Academic purpose: Mini-project for the M05 module
This solution is an extension of the project [Predicting house prices with machine learning](https://www.kimanalytics.com/single-post/2017/09/11/Predicting-House-Prices-with-Machine-Learning) of the data scientist Eric kim. 
### Goal
The aim of this project is to develop an intelligent tool for predicting house prices through machine learning. Such a tool is useful in that it would allow investors and real estate buyers, as well as the curious, to have an estimate of the value of houses in a given region, but also to know the characteristics that most influence house prices.

In this project, the hypotheses and tests carried out by [Eric kim](https://github.com/kimanalytics) will be re-discussed and other prediction algorithms other than linear regression, i.e. decision trees and random forests, will be implemented in order to see if the prediction solution can be improved.

### Documentation
Please go under the doc folder and get the project_report document in order to get further explanation about this project.
### Installation
Before running this package, please be sure to have all the below packages installed
* [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
* [Numpy](https://numpy.org/)
* [Pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org/)
* [Matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org/)
* [scikit-learn](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/)
* [SciPy](https://www.scipy.org/)

#### Installation procedure
    ``
    $ git clone https://github.com/CherubiniArt/mini_project_m05.git project
    $ cd project
    $ conda env create -f environment.yml
    $ conda activate house_prices_env
    (house_prices_env) $ # ready to run some scripts!
    ``

### Usage
 This part explains how to run the package to obtain the results published in our paper. Each results are associated to a specific configuration file called ``toolchain_all_params.py`` or ``toolchain_relevant_params.py``. Results can be re-generated by executing one of the following command:
 
 ``(house_prices_env) $ python toolchain_all_params.py`` 
 or 
 ``(house_prices_env) $ python toolchain_relevant_params.py``
